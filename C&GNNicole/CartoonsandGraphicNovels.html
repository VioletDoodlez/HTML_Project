A lot of people think cartoons and comics are for little kids, which isn't always fair. I've been a fan of them since I was a little kid. I love graphic novels that have a fantasy/adventure story to them, especially ones that span over the course of many books like <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> and <i>Lumberjanes</i>. As for cartoons, I love anything that makes me laugh that can also keep me invested like <i>The Owl House</i> and <i>Inside Job</i>.
