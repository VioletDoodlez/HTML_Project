Wonderlands is spinoff of the Borderlands series made by GearBox. Here, the player takes part of a DND game hosted by Tiny Tina, a character from the base games. The player (refered to as "newbie" by the other characters) must prevent the Wonderlands from falling into darkness and defeat the Dragon Lord. From multiple character customizations to an engaging story, this game has it all. Tina's narration adds to the comedy of the game. However, this game is definitely intended for an older audience due to the gun violence (despite taking place in a fantasy world) and foul language.
