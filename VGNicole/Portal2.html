Portal 2 is a puzzle game made by Valve. The player takes control of a test subject trying to escape a testing facility controlled by an evil AI. Using a portal gun and progressing through test chambers, you discover the mysterious history of the facility. I love this game because of its moderate diffuculty and creative level design. The characters, even the villain, make the game even more entertaining with their whitty dialogue and interaction with the player.
