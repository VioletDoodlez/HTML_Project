I love a wide variety of games, so long as they have an interesting story to tell. One of my favourites is <a href="Portal2.html"><i>Portal 2</i></a> because of its unique level design and how it pushes me to think. The reason I prefer the second one is because more backstory is included in this one. I like indie games as well! The last indie game I played was <a href="NSR.html"><i>No Straight Roads</i></a>, a game where you fight against a corrupt government with the power of rock music. It's a really colourful game with tons of personality and a great soundtrack. It is a little buggy though. I am current playing <a href="Wonderlands.html"><i>Wonderlands</i></a> which is a spinoff game of the <i>Borderlands</i> series, giving the original games a fantasy and DND inspired twist.
